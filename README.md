# Start up Instructions

In order to launch navigate to directory, run `npm i` then `npm start`

Navigate to `localhost:8080/`

## API Endpoints

There are currently two API endpoints defined:

* Formatter/:id - This returns a string of `Formatting for ${id}`
* Scraper/:id - This returns a string of `Scrape the ${id} resource.`

Examples:

`http://localhost:8080/formatter/journals`
`http://localhost:8080/scraper/journals`

Need to add Tests to it.
